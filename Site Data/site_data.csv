The focus is not only on soft/social skills but the entire process is now streamlined to a multifaceted and structured curriculum. The potential skill set requirements are identified earlier and starting from the second year we have a module at par with industry standards to ensure that they evolve to be future ready. Training is a continuous process and not limited to external interventions alone with having a dedicated internal team. The CGPU in association with the faculty team handling communication skills has developed a yearlong plan for assessment and in improving the language skills. Also aptitude and programming skills are given equal weightage and a structure is defined to ensure that the students attending the campus schedule in the final year will be acquainted with the process from early stages of the course.The CGPU of the college intend to scale up the activities related with training and placements with a much broader framework than just limiting its activities to the normal mode of providing recruitment opportunities alone. In the long run, unit intends to handhold the students with a holistic approach on career and life rather than just functioning as a placement support function which compliments the education objectives of respective departments.

MITS B-Hub
Incubation is the process of nurturing early stage startups by providing them infrastructural, management and networking support. Incubation centres provide support to startup companies which include consultation, business plan assistance, growth acceleration and development of product or prototypes.
Business Incubation is designed to encourage and nurture new and small businesses by supporting them through the initial phases of development. The incubation programs are often sponsored by private companies or municipal entities and public institutions, such as colleges and universities.
Their goal is to help create and nurture a business eco-system by providing them with necessary support through financial and technical services. The mission of Incubation Centre is to nurture and empower the next generation entrepreneurs to serve local problems. The students, alumni and also local people can come up with their ideas which might lead to the start-up.
MITS decided to set up an Incubation centre in the campus to facilitate and handhold potential and aspiring entrepreneurs in the early phase of their establishment. The MITS B-HUB will give priority to our alumni and student entrepreneurs, but we are giving equal opportunities for the public especially for the local people also.
An area of 151.20 sq.m is taken for this purpose in the first floor of the Isaac Newton Hall of the institute. Four startup spaces are arranged in this area as the first phase which includes a well-furnished conference hall and a waiting area.
MITS B-Hub inaugurated by Sri Sijo Kuruvila.
InQbe Technologies becomes the first start-up to be incubated at MITS B-Hub.
MoU signed by Mr Mohammed Aslam, CEO of InQbe Innovations on 04 Sep 2019.

Relentless passion for excellence...
(Promoted by The Muthoot Group)
Centre for Industrial Consultancy, Inter disciplinary Research, Innovation & Entrepreneurship
(CIDRIE)
Objectives and goals of CIDRIE
The centre will help to bring faculty and students together to develop, refresh and exercise their research skills by helping to solve real world problems facing businesses, government and the community in general. The centre would primarily be having the following four goals:
To teach applied research methods to students and interested faculty.
To provide faculty with applied research opportunity.
To produce high quality low cost information for the local stakeholders (the Institute, Muthoot Group, Small & Medium Industries and Businesses, Government Bodies, Social Welfare Workers, NGOs).
Be an incubation centre for start-ups and help guide entrepreneurs.
Summary of the initiative
The Research Centre, in order to achieve its objectives, would have in the initial phase four major sub centres, namely:
Centre for Sustainable Innovation
Centre for Entrepreneurship Incubation
Centre for IC&SR (Industrial Consultancy & Sponsored Research)
A Tinker Lab for Developing Crazy Ideas
There are four major stake holders – The Muthoot Group, The Institute, Industry and the local community (represented by the government). All the four participants/stakeholders would be providing capital in terms of funding or man power and skill to the research centre. The research centre in turn would be providing its services to these four agencies.
The Centre would be composed of the following functional units:
Research Centre Advisory Board
Research Centre Core Team
Centres of excellence and Laboratories
IT, Secretarial and Laboratory Staff
Legal Counsel: Intellectual Property.
The research centre would be following a Design Thinking based approach for solution development and deployment. The major activities undertaken for problem resolution is shown below.
CIDRIE is a platform that brings together students, technical staff, faculty and researchers to foster interdisciplinary research and Innovation in varied areas of interest and inquiry. The centre provides an environment that stimulates collaboration and inspiration.
Projects are spread across diverse disciplines spanning the length, breadth and depth of human inquiry and interest like social causes, healthcare, sustainability, disruptive technologies, art, culture education and teaching & learning methodology. The aim is to give back to the society and the institute by working on any problem / issue from various relevant areas like social causes, healthcare, sustainability, disruptive technologies, art, culture education and teaching &amp; learning methodology.
People are prompted to think exponentially, to think big and to think “out of the box”. CIDRIE is a place that inspires people to do the things that inspire them. People can try out crazy ideas without the fear of being looked down upon or made fun of. At the same time people and ideas are kept grounded to the real world through expert mentoring and support. It is a place where one finds happiness through the act of engaging in ones favourite pursuits as well as through the act of giving back to both the Institute and the country.
Come to us with an idea and we will help you develop a product and start a business. Come to us with a problem and we will design a solution for it.

The internal and external challenges of our youngsters are to be resolved in order to empower them properly to become not only a good Engineer but also a good human being.

We welcome you to approach us with any problem, be it academic, emotional or social, without any hesitation.

Principal’s Message
At the outset, I must thank you for choosing Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science as your preferred destination for launching yourself as an engineering professional. As engineering professionals, we are bound to provide technological solutions to the world at large. At MITS, its our endeavour to create an ambience that would expose students to problems early on, and train them to be solution providers. Towards this aim, we have created a magnificent infrastructure, comprising of well-equipped laboratories, libraries, classrooms, seminar halls, cafeterias, playgrounds and hostels. We have expert teachers from varying disciplines to guide you through every step. There are plenty of avenues to showcase your curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular talent, and some links in this website would provide you a glimpse of those possibilities as well. Additionally, inadequacies in existing curriculum are compensated with add-on courses and other specialist industry-guided initiatives. A large pool of students who pursue higher studies after qualifying at GATE, also is a direct indication that our ambience is perfect for multiple roles promoting life-long learning. It is no wonder then, that MITS is one of the preferred destinations for companies searching for young talented professionals. I look forward to your suggestions on how to improve our campus and make it a dream destination for young budding graduates.

It results in equipping faculty with latest practices and makes the students industry-ready by providing exposure to current industry practices, and hones their skills to adapt to changing technologies. For students it is important because they get an exposure to industry and subsequent placement in various disciplines. On the other hand, with the advent of globalization and opening up of Indian economy to the outside world, competition among industries has become stiff, so industries also need good resources, who are well aware of industry standards and capable of achieving it. Therefore, there is an urgent need for interaction of industry and academic institutions, by which, academic institutes can prepare students for jobs in industries and industry will also be benefited by the possibility of receiving a well-trained workforce. IIIC shall also enable the staff and students of MITS to undertake research relevant to the industry.

COVID’19 Related Activities
As part of our societal responsibility in the face of a global pandemic, a number of useful technological interventions have been initiated by the faculty members and students of MITS. These activities have been coordinated by the Covid Cell functioning at MITS.
Alpha Droid – “Robot to assist frontline COVID-19 Healthcare workers”
http://mgmits.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ALPHADROID_Updated.compressed-1.mp4
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is needed to maintain social distancing. However, this is not possible for a medical worker, as they are expected  to take care of the patients by providing food and medicine at regular intervals. Though they are provided with protective kits, as the whole world is in a crisis situation, there is a shortage of these kits at many locations, making their life at stake. It is not enough to just provide the patients with food and medicine. It is also important to communicate with them to understand their needs.
‘Alpha droid’, a remotely controlled robot to assist medical workers for the timely dispense of food and medicine to the COVID-19 patients. It is a RF controlled Robot transmitting live visuals to a remote location (up to 100 meters). It carries weight (food and medicine) up to 20 Kilogram. Patients can communicate using voice and video with the person at the remote location for their needs.When a robot is deployed to assist the medical workers in dispensing the necessary materials, the Covid spread to the medical workers can be controlled. After every dispensing routine the robot can be disinfected manually with required precautions.  We plan to add UV disinfecting of the space occupied by Covid-19 patients as an extra feature soon.
This project was designed and developed by final year students (2016-2020 Batch) of Muthoot Institute of technology and Science. The students behind this project are Ananthu Anil, AjayDas CF, Rohith Rajendran, Feba M Varghese. The project was mentored by ECE Department faculties, Dr. Arunkant A Jose, Mr. Baiju Karun, and Ms. Megha Franklin. This project is funded under CSR initiative of Muthoot Group.
Advanced Non Contact Temperature Detector
 Students from S4 Mechanical department, discovered an easy method to adhere to the protocol of pandemic. Fever is one among the early symptoms of the virus. As a preventive measure at workspace, they developed an Automatic Body Temperature Sensor which detects one’s body temperature and check whether it is below acceptable temperature or not. The device performs the following actions 
1. Record ID card Number  
2. Automatically measure body temperature 
3. Display the recorded data 
4. Alert the person with abnormal temperature.
By using this product, everyone entering the firm will be scanned and an alert would be triggered accordingly. 
Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispensers
Two different models of dispensers were built on campus. One dispenser was designed by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, which is a wall-mountable model, and works by detecting the presence of any object using an ultrasonic distance sensor. Even though it is slightly bulky, the dispenser has been designed in such a way that we can use regular sanitiser bottles inside it. A second model was designed by the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, which is a desktop model, and works in a similar fashion, but dispenses using a fountain instead of normal plungers. The model is smaller compared to the earlier one, but uses a custom container to hold the contents.

Contribution to coronasafe.network
A team of 8 students and one faculty member from Department of Computer Science and Engineering have been associated with coronasafe.network, which is a crowdsourced platform for managing COVID-19 cases in Kerala. It also has associations with district control rooms of KSDMA. The first stage of contribution was on building analytical dashboards to track testing and results. At the next stage, a software was built using in React and Nestjs, which aimed for providing stays to the people for their quarantine period. Hotel administration had an option to register in it and get their rooms available for quarantine stay listed in it and others were provided with booking facility. The hotel administrator would be provided with all the booking details too. The software can be accessed at https://stay.coronasafe.network. The source code repositories are available at http://github.com/coronasafe/stay_be  and http://github.com/coronasafe/stay_fe.
Report submitted to AICTE
As part of the initiative by Government of India through AICTE, the institution submitted a report on how COVID-19 impacts domains like Agriculture, Education, Medicine, Technology, IT, and E-Business. It also described how strategies can be built to recover in the post-COVID scenario. It also builds a comparison of the current pandemic situation with the likes of Spanish Flu of 1918.    
Contributions of NSS Technical Cell, MITS
The NSS Technical Cell took up the following activities as part of COVID-19 management.
1.Online campaigns
2.Plant-A-Tree challenge
3.NSS Sannadhasena (volunteers)
4.Online orientation for NSS volunteers
5.Mask making – 500 nos

We have expert teachers from varying disciplines to guide you through every step. There are plenty of avenues to showcase your curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular talent, and some links in this website would provide you a glimpse of those possibilities as well. Additionally, inadequacies in existing curriculum are compensated with add-on courses and other specialist industry-guided initiatives. A large pool of students who pursue higher studies after qualifying at GATE, also is a direct indication that our ambience is perfect for multiple roles promoting life-long learning. It is no wonder then, that MITS is one of the preferred destinations for companies searching for young talented professionals.
