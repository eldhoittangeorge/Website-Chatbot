"COVID’19 Related Activities As part of our societal responsibility in the face of a global pandemic, a number of useful technological interventions have been initiated by the faculty members and students of MITS. These activities have been coordinated by the Covid Cell functioning at MITS. Alpha Droid – “Robot to assist frontline COVID-19 Healthcare workers” To prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is needed to maintain social distancing. However, this is not possible for a medical worker, as they are expected to take care of the patients by providing food and medicine at regular intervals. Though they are provided with protective kits, as the whole world is in a crisis situation, there is a shortage of these kits at many locations, making their life at stake. It is not enough to just provide the patients with food and medicine. It is also important to communicate with them to understand their needs. ‘Alpha droid’, a remotely controlled robot to assist medical workers for the timely dispense of food and medicine to the COVID-19 patients. It is a RF controlled Robot transmitting live visuals to a remote location (up to 100 meters). It carries weight (food and medicine) up to 20 Kilogram. Patients can communicate using voice and video with the person at the remote location for their needs.When a robot is deployed to assist the medical workers in dispensing the necessary materials, the Covid spread to the medical workers can be controlled. After every dispensing routine the robot can be disinfected manually with required precautions. We plan to add UV disinfecting of the space occupied by Covid-19 patients as an extra feature soon. This project was designed and developed by final year students (2016-2020 Batch) of Muthoot Institute of technology and Science. The students behind this project are Ananthu Anil, AjayDas CF, Rohith Rajendran, Feba M Varghese. The project was mentored by ECE Department faculties, Dr. Arunkant A Jose, Mr. Baiju Karun, and Ms. Megha Franklin. This project is funded under CSR initiative of Muthoot Group. Students from S4 Mechanical department, discovered an easy method to adhere to the protocol of pandemic. Fever is one among the early symptoms of the virus. As a preventive measure at workspace, they developed an Automatic Body Temperature Sensor which detects one’s body temperature and check whether it is below acceptable temperature or not. The device performs the following actions 1. Record ID card Number 2. Automatically measure body temperature 3. Display the recorded data 4. Alert the person with abnormal temperature. By using this product, everyone entering the firm will be scanned and an alert would be triggered accordingly. Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispensers Two different models of dispensers were built on campus. One dispenser was designed by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, which is a wall-mountable model, and works by detecting the presence of any object using an ultrasonic distance sensor. Even though it is slightly bulky, the dispenser has been designed in such a way that we can use regular sanitiser bottles insideit. A second model was designed by the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, which is a desktop model, and works in a similar fashion, but dispenses using a fountain instead of normal plungers. The model is smaller compared to the earlier one, but uses a custom container to hold the contents. Register here to learn the making of an automatic hand sanitiser dispenser Contribution to coronasafe.network A team of 8 students and one faculty member from Department of Computer Science and Engineering have been associated with coronasafe.network, which is a crowdsourced platform for managing COVID-19 cases in Kerala. It also has associations with district control rooms of KSDMA. The first stage of contribution was on building analytical dashboards to track testing and results. At the next stage, a software was built using in React and Nestjs, which aimed for providing stays to the people for their quarantine period. Hotel administration had an option to register in it and get their rooms available for quarantine stay listed in it andotherswere provided with bookingfacility. The hotel administrator would be provided with all the booking details too.The software can be accessed at . The source code repositories are available at Report submitted to AICTE As part of the initiative by Government of India through AICTE, the institution submitted a report on how COVID-19 impacts domains like Agriculture, Education, Medicine, Technology, IT, and E-Business. It also described how strategies can be built to recover in the post-COVID scenario. It also builds a comparison of the current pandemic situation with the likes of Spanish Flu of 1918.

The conference provides a platform for not only to the researchers from Asia but also from other continents across the globe, making this conference more international and attractive for participants. The conference will include a peer reviewed program of technical sessions, workshops, tutorials, and demonstration sessions. This conference provides a forum for leading experts from the smart computing, embedded systems programming, high-performance computing and power systems community to present their latest research, exchange ideas, and conduct brainstorming applications. ICSCC 2021 has a special theme this time, that is ‘ ‘. The theme is considered to be of great interest to many countries in general, and to India in particular. Whether we realise it or not, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is lurking in the background, assisting, monitoring or influencing humans in most activities of their daily life. The range of applications that make use of AI gets increasing with each passing day. Some of such popular applications include personalising experience-based content-driven browsing, social-media interactions, online-shopping, travel and navigation to quote a few. There are also many other domains like finance, healthcare, automated navigation, smart automotives, smart home environment, creative arts, and even smart customer interactions. AI based solutions for smart surveillance, smart forensics and investigation also lie at the other end of the application spectrum, some of which are made heavy use of by those states that attempt to govern lives of citizens by deploying instruments of control. The theme, therefore is both fascinating and intriguing at the same time, as AI applications appear to possess capabilities to enhance the human experiences through smarter services, and also make people vulnerable to be victims in the ever expanding automated surveillance mechanism as well. With the availability of improved and sophisticated frameworks for rapid prototyping, testing and deployment, human imaginations on AI based applications seem to be taking less time to realise. These unique characteristics inhibiting the overall AI environment, are bound to make this Conference more interesting and appealing to a wide section of researchers and users.
