possible for a medical worker, as they are expected to take care of the patients by providing food and medicine at regular intervals. though they are provided with protective kits, as the whole world is in a crisis situation, there is a shortage of these kits at many locations, making their life at stake. it is not enough to just provide the patients with food and medicine. it is also important to communicate with them to understand their needs. ‘alpha droid’, a remotely controlled robot to assist medical workers for the timely dispense of food and medicine to the covid-19 patients. it is a rf controlled robot transmitting live visuals to a remote location (up to 100 meters). it carries weight (food and medicine) up to 20 kilogram. patients can communicate using voice and video with the person at the remote location for their needs.when a robot is deployed to assist the medical workers in dispensing the necessary materials, the covid spread to the medical workers can be controlled. after every dispensing routine the robot can be disinfected manually with required precautions. we plan to add uv disinfecting of the space occupied by covid-19 patients as an extra feature soon. this project was designed and developed by final year students (2016-2020 batch) of muthoot institute of technology and science. the students behind this project are ananthu anil, ajaydas cf, rohith

group. students from s4 mechanical department, discovered an easy method to adhere to the protocol of pandemic. fever is one among the early symptoms of the virus. as a preventive measure at workspace, they developed an automatic body temperature sensor which detects one’s body temperature and check whether it is below acceptable temperature or not. the device performs the following actions 1. record id card number 2. automatically measure body temperature 3. display the recorded data 4. alert the person with abnormal temperature. by using this product, everyone entering the firm will be scanned and an alert would be triggered accordingly. two different models of dispensers were built on campus. one dispenser was designed by the department of electrical and electronics engineering, which is a wall-mountable model, and works by detecting the presence of any object using an ultrasonic distance sensor. even though it is slightly bulky, the dispenser has been designed in such a way that we can use regular sanitiser bottles insideit. a second model was designed by the department of electronics and communication engineering, which is a desktop model, and works in a similar fashion, but dispenses using a fountain instead of normal plungers. the model is smaller compared to the earlier one, but uses a custom container to hold the contents. register here to learn the making of an automatic hand sanitiser dispenser a team of 8 students and one faculty member from department of computer science and engineering have been associated with coronasafe.network, which
